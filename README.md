## 🌟 Overview  
**BizzUp** is an online platform designed to help Greencastle residents discover, support, and engage with local businesses.

## 🚩 Problem  
Small businesses in Greencastle often face challenges with visibility and customer retention. With limited promotion and word-of-mouth marketing, many shops and service providers remain under the radar.

> For example: Many locals may not know that *Bodega* offers unique imports like “Ba Co Gai” rice paper!

**Key Insight:** There’s a need for a centralized platform to bridge this gap and foster visibility, engagement, and growth for local businesses.
